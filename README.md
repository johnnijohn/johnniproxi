# Johnni Proxi

***Proxi plus games.***

I am aware of the main file index.html not working, working on a fix. you currently will have to manually open each file for games and the proxy, DO NOT RUN TO ME ABOUT IT NOT WORKING WHEN YOU CLICKED THE INDEX FILE THE MAIN PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION again. https://johnnijohn.github.io/johnniproxi/ the main page is still not working currently, made a error on my part mb, Im going to republish this when we fix the main file issue. Might have this resolved around late february or early march.

IN ORDER TO USE IT WHEN DOWNLOADED TAKE THE proxy.html FILE AND TAKE IT AND DRAG IT INTO A TAB
